## Requirements

Please check off which features you have implemented:

- [✓] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [✓] An interesting and beautiful frontend design with a catchy title and cool fonts and colors that looks good on any screen size.
- [✓] A home page with a summary about the interesting thing you want to teach me about. I was originally planning for this to be purely academic (e.g. math, CS, physics, engineering) topics but I am expanding it to include anything. However, you should be able to teach about whatever you choose in a clear way and go in-depth about it. If your subject matter is particularly engaging, that will reflect positively on your application.
- [✓] Extra pages with more detailed information on certain topics. Make your website intuitive to navigate through, both within the pages themselves and in your choice of pages. You can structure your website however you see fit.
- [✓] A poll/quiz feature where you can check that the user is aborbing the information your website teaches about well. These quiz questions should be scattered throughout the website, and they should tell the user whether they got the answer right or not once they select it. Additionally, it should show a live count of results (like a social media poll) with the names of the users who have voted for each option. You should take time to make sure your UI for this component is intuitive to use while still including all of the features listed. A user should be able to change their result if they want, and this should be reflected in the result count.
- [✓] A comment feature on each page where users can offer feedback or ask questions based on the lesson on the page. The home page does not need a comment section, but every other page should have one.
- [✓] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion

1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

Overall, the project went well and was a great learning experience. I particularly enjoyed working with Three.js for the first time. It was exciting to create 3D visualizations, especially those that represented concepts like quantum entanglement and particles. I found that I was equally comfortable working on both the backend and frontend aspects of the project, which helped me maintain a good balance throughout the development process, although working on frontend UI was certainly more engaging.

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

The assessment was actually a pleasant surprise, as it differed from what I initially expected. I’ve typically worked on projects aimed at performing, automating, or optimizing services or tasks for users, so creating a project with an educational focus was a nice change of pace. During development, I started building an “escape room” style game with Three.js. that would need to be solved using some topics covered, but I ended up scrapping it because I was concerned it might be too ambitious to complete within the timeframe. If I had another two weeks, I would definitely revisit that idea, focusing on debugging and implementing the game mechanics.
